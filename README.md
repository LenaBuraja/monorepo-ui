# monorepo-ui
This is an example of how to configure a monorepo, supporting React Native (through Expo) and siloed React components development through Storybook.

The main idea is that you develop your UI components in isolation, promoting easier maintanability, testability and reuse of these components, while promoting consistency across even multiple applications.

## Installation

```
yarn
```

## Running Expo

```
yarn start
```

## Running Storybook

```
yarn storybook
```
